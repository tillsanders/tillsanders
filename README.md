# Hallo, I'm Till ðŸ‘‹
from the cloudy mountains of LÃ¼denÂ­scheid, Germany
Being both a Designer and a Web Developer, I spent the last decade learning about and shaping the difficult interaction between human and metal minds.

## Here's what I'm currently working on :heart:

- [**FinanzRitter**](https://finanzritter.com) ~ Co-founder, Chief Product Officer<br>
  I take pride in making the most challenging concepts easily accessible and put this to good use as co-founder of FinanzRitter, a digital insurance broker.

- [**OpenElectionCompass**](https://open-election-compass.com) ~ Creator<br>
  I'm passionate about free and open source software and created the OpenÂ­ElectionÂ­Compass to support political education, participation and democracy.

A quick shout-out to some great projects, teams and individuals whose work I really appreciate: Vue, Nuxt, Laravel, OpenCollective, Apple, Jest, Figma, Affinity, @sindresorhus, @thetutlage. You guys rock :metal:

I use my open source projects to keep learning new stuff. Currently I'm diving deeper into Nest.js, MongoDB and GraphQL.

If you would like to talk to me, just do ;)
